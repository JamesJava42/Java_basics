POM.xml ==> Its a MAven POM.xml used to build the oroject(WHich includes the dependences for applications)
Adding class Path Dependencies==> Spring boot provide No.of "starter" dependencies Ex: "spring-boot-starter-parent" inside the parent section
                               which have default maven jar files and also dependency-maangement( Where we can Omit the "version" tag)

                               For developing Spring boot web application we add "Spring-boot-starter-web": " It adds the Tomcat and the Spring MVC"  dependency to pom file.

                              mvn dependency:tree ==> disply the tree structure of dependencies


Executable Jars: (Fat Jars): archives containing compiled classes and all jar dependencies reqired to run the code. 

Java doesn't provide a standered way to load nested jar files. Which can be a Problematic to distribute a self-contained application.
To solve it , We use Uber jars . Which pack all the classes in a application's dependencies in to a single archive 
Probles:
      Hard to identified which liberes are from applications.
      same filenames can exits from diffrent applications.

Spring Boot takes Diffrent approach: which directly nests the jars.

--> To create a executable jar, need to add "spring-boot-maven-plugin"
Annotaions ==>

@RestController :
                SteroType ANnotation(hints to readers) as it a spring web @Controller spring consider during handling the webRequests.

@RequestMapping : 
                It provides the routing information, any http request with / should mapped to the home method.
                It tells the spring render the resulting string directly to the caller

(@RestController and @RequestMapping are spring MVC annotations not restricted to the Spring boot)

@SpringBootApplication : meta ANnotation. It combines (@springBootConfiguration , @EnableAutoConfiguration and @CompoundScan)
                        
                        @EnableAutoConfiguration: Which tells the spring that to configure automatically based on the dependencies I added in pom file.
